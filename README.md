# Reverse Engineering 101

This is a course I am working on and teaching for how to learn reverse engineering. Each chapter will contain a readme and a pdf, the pdf is generated from the readme but you are advised to use the pdf as some items are not rendered on github readme pages.

Each chapter also contains some sample files that are used in the lectures to better facilitate teaching. As more feedback comes in from the lessons the files and code snippets will be linked to actual exercises that people can follow. For now they can rewatch the recorded lectures to see how the files are used and can follow along with the video.
